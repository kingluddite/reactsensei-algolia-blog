## Prework
* Before you begin, make sure you’ve installed the MySQL NPM package
* **note** This info was compiled on `01.26.2020` (please update if any links or information becomes updated)

`package.json`

```javascript
{
  "name": "mvc_design",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.16.3",
    "express-handlebars": "^3.0.0",
    "mysql": "^2.16.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "handlebars-helper-css": "^0.1.0"
  }
}
```

## Part 1: Creating a JawsDB Remote Database
* On your local machine, navigate to your project folder
    * **note** At this point, we’ll assume you’ve been pushing/pulling your code with GitHub but have yet to deploy it to Heroku
    * **note** This is an important assumption because in order to deploy your site to Heroku it is a requirement that your site is using `Git`

![All Database files are included and ready for deployment](https://i.imgur.com/w4ezjNl.png)

* **important** Make sure you have all the files you need to interact with a basic MySQL database

* You should have the [Heroku CLI installed](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) before you can continue

### Log into Heroku
`$ heroku login`

* Log into Heroku via the command line using the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/command-line)
* **note** Heroku CLI `$ heroku login` [now opens the browser by default](https://devcenter.heroku.com/changelog-items/1530)

### Create a new app using the Heroku CLI
`$ heroku create`

* [docs for creating apps with the Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/creating-apps)

### Open the browser and log into the Admin Dashboard of your app
* Look for the `Add-Ons` section in your app's dashboard and type `JawsDB` in the input field
    - That should bring up the `JawsDB MySQL add-on`
    - [What is JawsDB?](https://www.jawsdb.com/docs/)
    - [Heroku info on JawsDB](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/jawsdb)

![Search for JawsDB on Heroku](https://i.imgur.com/yWuYqwy.png) 

* Click on JawsDB MySQL and that should bring up a modal asking you to provision a specific tier plan

![Provision JawsDB Free](https://i.imgur.com/kCXlUrq.png)

* **important** Make sure you select the free option, then click the Provision button

#### How do I know if Heroku set up my JawsDB Database?
* You'll know Heroku set up JawsDB properly if it shows up under the `Add-Ons` section

![JawsDB is set up properly](https://i.imgur.com/DZV8PSt.png)

### JawsDB MySQL settings
* Click on JawsDB MySQL to bring up the setting to your remote Database
    - **note** You will use this information later
    - **important** This is `secret` information that should remain secret (if anyone has this information that can delete or corrupt your Database)

![JawsDB MySQL connection information](https://i.imgur.com/CB1VB9l.png)

## Part 2: Wiring your project up with JawsDB
* In you app's `connection.js` (_or whatever file you created to include your MySQL connection information_), add the code shown below

`config/connection.js`

```javascript
// MORE CODE

if (process.env.JAWSDB_URL) {
  connection = mysql.createConnection(process.env.JAWSDB_URL);
} else {
  var connection = mysql.createConnection({
    host: "localhost",
    port: 3306,
    user: "root",
    password: "password",
    database: "cat_db"
  });
}

// MORE CODE
```

### Explaining the code above
* We add a simple `if` statement to find out which environment we are in
    - When set up the JawsDB provision on Heroku, Heroku added an environment variable automatically for us called `JAWSDB_URL`
        + To verify this go the `Setting` tab in your app's Heroku Dashboard
        + Click the `Reveal Config Vars` button to see what Environment variables you have on Heroku for your app
* If the server contains the JAWSDB_URL our server will know you are in your production environment on Heroku and connect to your remote MySQL Database via your JAWSDB_URL environment variable
    - Else (if JAWSDB_URL is not defined) your server will know you are in your development environment and it will connect to your local MySQL database

## Keep secret stuff secret!
* If you're concerned about your production environment variable being visible (_and therefore unsecured_) have no fear, the good news is using environment variables saves us from exposing secret information to the public
    - Only someone logged in to your Heroku app Dashboard can see the value of your Heroku environment variables (like JAWSDB_URL)
    - You can upload this `connection.js` file to GitHub without worrying about finding your remote connection credentials since that info is hidden in the environment variable

![click Reveal Config Vars button](https://i.imgur.com/owcC94D.png)

* You will see that `JAWSDB_URL` has been set to a connection string representing your Database connection to MySQL via JawsDB

![JAWSDB_URL is set as an environment variable on Heroku](https://i.imgur.com/IFdpMQ8.png)

* We saw this string earlier when we opened the Heroku `Connection Info` (_See the highlighted part of this image which is the Database connection string that was saved to your Heroku environment variables - obviously your string will be unique to your app_)

![Database connection string](https://i.imgur.com/yrt0qbS.png)

* After modifying the code your connection file will look like:

`config/connection.js`

```javascript
// Set up MySQL connection.
var mysql = require("mysql");

if (process.env.JAWSDB_URL) {
  connection = mysql.createConnection(process.env.JAWSDB_URL);
} else {
  var connection = mysql.createConnection({
    host: "localhost",
    port: 3306,
    user: "root",
    password: "password",
    database: "cat_db"
  });
}

// Make connection.
connection.connect(function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.error("error connecting: " + err.stack);
    return;
  }
  console.log("connected as id " + connection.threadId);
});

// Export connection for our ORM to use.
module.exports = connection;
```

## Push to your GitHub repo
`$ git push origin master`

## Push also to your Heroku Git repo
`$ git push heroku master`

## Part 3: Adding Your projects tables to JawsDB
* After deploying to Heroku open your app in the browser

`$ heroku open`

* You will receive an error because your code is trying to access a SQL table that does not exist and we can't show any data because we haven't seeded any data
* Now we have to manually create the tables in our remote Heroku JawsDB instance so we can properly connect to it
* JawsDB includes certain fields that we must employ in our project (If we don't do this we won't be able to use the remote Database)

### Open your GUI software of your choice (Sequel Pro, MySQL Workbench, Valentina Studio, HeidiSQL, etc)
* Open the `Settings` page for your JawsDB on Heroku which will look similar to:

![JawsDB Heroku Connection Info](https://i.imgur.com/lNY8arp.png)

### Plug in Connection info into your Database GUI
* The following screenshots will be from `MySQL Workbench`
* Create a connection to your Remote Heroku JawsDB Database

![Database connection info in Workbench](https://i.imgur.com/iSMDmpf.png)

* You need to plug in your `Host`, `Username` and `Password`
* Click the `Test Connection` button to verify you successfully connected to your remote Database on Heroku
* **IMPORTANT** It's easy to accidentally copy an extra space from the settings page
    - Make sure there are no empty spaces at the end of your `Host`, `Username`, or `Password` values (Triple check this!)

### Write some SQL
* Once you are connected to your JawsDB on Heroku, you need to go into the database (_Heroku when it automatically created your Database it gave it a randomly created name - something crazy random like `nthzbxarfumqc0s5`_)
* You will this randomly created name in your GUI
* Just add similar SQL to use that Database, create a table and insert some seed data

![GUI to manually add SQL](https://i.imgur.com/0t4JMYT.png)

* Here is some sample SQL

```sql
Use remote Database for Heroku

USE `hjqldj22npslsb3q`;

CREATE TABLE cats
(
  id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  sleepy BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  createdAt TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

ALTER TABLE `hjqldj22npslsb3q`.`cats` 
CHANGE COLUMN `createdAt` `createdAt` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ;

INSERT INTO cats (name) VALUES ('Meeses');
INSERT INTO cats (name) VALUES ('Bobbi');
INSERT INTO cats (name, sleepy) VALUES ('Sylvester', true);
INSERT INTO cats (name, sleepy) VALUES ('Marilyn Manson', true);
INSERT INTO cats (name, sleepy) VALUES ('Joe Biden', true);
INSERT INTO cats (name) VALUES ('Owens');
```

* Verify that all the SQL was executed properly

![SQL executed properly](https://i.imgur.com/ycEFfgh.png)

* **note** In the above SQL there is code to alter the `createAt` column to just automatically insert the current `timestamp` into your Database table as the value for every time a record is created
    - You could do this with SQL or you could use your GUI Database interface to do the same thing (each GUI Database has different instructions on how to do this)

![GUI alter table column](https://i.imgur.com/Wkcm65G.png)

### Refresh GUI
* You should be able to see something similar after expanding your GUI

![MySQL table and columns](https://i.imgur.com/48bew4N.png)

### Run SQL
* To select all records from the Database table and you should see something similar to:

![SQL executed and shown result set](https://i.imgur.com/62BerE4.png)

### Run your app in the browser
`$ heroku open`

* You should see no errors in the terminal and you should see your app running in the Heroku URL that opened in the browser

## Troubleshooting
* If you run into any errors, try going over the steps again to ensure that you haven't missed anything
* You can avoid any errors by checking the following:
    - You set up your `connection.js` folder as outlined in the steps above
    - You copied your JawsDB server details exactly as they appeared in your remote Heroku app add on Settings page (_Be sure that you did not copy any empty spaces!_)
* You can view the deploy log on your Heroku app's Overview tab by clicking the `view build log` link

![view build log link](https://i.imgur.com/MmkvA6A.png)

* The log will look similar to:

![view build log](https://i.imgur.com/Y2whoyg.png)

* Another way is to view the Heroku server log via your terminal (make sure you are logged into Heroku via the Heroku CLI)

`$ heroku logs`

* This log can get pretty long so you can truncate it using:

`$ heroku logs --tail`


## Congratulations!
* You now know how to deploy an app using MySQL to Heroku
* Well done!
